Normally I would use DiscordConnector and in the past it worked brilliantly for me, but this time around I was not able to make the leaderboards work, so me and the AI decided to try our hand at making our own MOD. This is basic at this level, it simply posts that players are online and lists their name. Leaderboards are my next plan of action. 

Join us over in The Lands of Dredd Discord server and play Valheim with us on our dedicated server.
